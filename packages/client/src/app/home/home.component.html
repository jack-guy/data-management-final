  <b>Welcome to Company DB!</b>
</p>
<p class="mat-body-1">
  This web application allows you to view and manipulate data from a StarDog semantic database. This is accomplished via Stardog 5's GraphQL API.
</p>
<p class="mat-body-1">
  While there is not currently a GUI to create ones own "CompanyDB" application, all forms, tables, and pages are created dynamically using a basic Node.js API server. In the future, this API could easily be expanded to create Stardog web applications without a line of code.
</p>
<p class="mat-body-1">
  To get started, click on one of the pages on the left navigation bar. Scalar data can be previewed in tabular form, with search and sorting functionality. Additionally, upon click, EVAs will preview their corresponding entities in a pop-up box. The EVAs in that pop-up are also previewable, and so on.
</p>
<p class="mat-body-1">
  Entities may be updated or created. Due to the nature of semantic data management systems, little validation logic is implemented (or needed) in the client application itself.
